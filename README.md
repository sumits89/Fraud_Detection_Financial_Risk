Project Description
The AI-Based Fraud Detection project leverages advanced machine learning algorithms to detect fraudulent transactions. By analyzing a given dataset, the system learns patterns and characteristics associated with fraudulent activities, allowing it to classify new transactions as either fraudulent or legitimate.

The project includes several key components:

Data preprocessing: The dataset undergoes cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering to prepare it for model training.
Model training: Machine learning and deep learning models, such as XGBOOST or ANN, are trained using the preprocessed data.
Evaluation: The trained models are evaluated using various metrics, such as precision, recall, AUC, and F1 score.
Fraud detection: The system applies the trained model to new, unseen data to identify potential fraudulent transactions.
